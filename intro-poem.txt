Every Christmas morning, in any given town
during the early hours, before the moon goes down

The gifts santa brought sit under the tree
The Sugar Goblin then says, "Why these must be for me!"

While the children are nestled all snug in their beds
The goblin comes out to dance on their heads

He eats all the candies, and eats all the sweets
He zips down the lights & hooks on the wreaths

He moves so fast, there's no keeping track
Then he's off with your toys in his red sack
